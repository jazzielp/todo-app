## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript - For type safety
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- I learned to better handle useContext for state management.
- To type better with TypeScript.
- To be able to do a manual drag and drop without using a third-party library.

### Continued development

Continue learning Typescrip with React. Continue doing projects to increase the difficulty
